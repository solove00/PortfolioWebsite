      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <p>Since the dawn of the ice age, humans and animals have had a special bond. They are like family to us. We love our pets so much and would like to take good care of them whenever we can. When we are away, we would like to find someone that love
            our pets as much as we do to take care of them. PuppyFace is an app that offers reliable and free pet services to your pets. Why is PuppyFace free? Because we encourage pet owners to help each other, we use credits as a way to record when
            a pet owner provide or receive service. The purpose is to reduce the cost of pet service, and at the same time, our pets receive services from other pet owners which is more reliable. </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <p>Even though there are many pet services apps in the marketplace, many of the current service providers are expensive and can’t meet pet owner’s requirements for cost and service. Rover is the most significant pet boarding app right now. But
            many pet sitters on Rover are asking for expensive service fees regardless of their service quality. Pet service fee is much higher for holidays. Traveling out of town during holidays become more difficult when you have to consider the cost,
            and worry about your pet’s stay at somebody’s house. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <p>PuppyFace solves the problems of expensive and unreliable pet services by building a credit based service exchange system between pet owners. With PuppyFace, pet owners can specify their preference for a boarding place, pet sitter’s experience,
            then book a service using credits (PuppyFace will give every new user ten free credits to start with). And at the same time, pet owners can also receive and check service requests from other pet owners. If the service request is accepted and
            finished, then the pet owner will gain credits and can be used for future pet service for his/her pets. Since the platform is not money involved and pet owners provide service to each other, PuppyFace is a more reliable and low-cost tool to
            find pet service. </p>

            between these two. Because the cuteness of pets can attract users, and the cleanness and simple can make users feel reliable.</p>

          <p>The word “puppyface” came up when I was browsing some dog’s facebook pages. Puppy with cute and smiling faces usually gets a lot more “likes.” People’s heart is melty when they see a puppy. When I first walked my dog in the community as he was
            a puppy, he drew a lot of attention from my neighbors like a superstar. It is hard for people to ignore puppies’ innocent and adorable faces. </p>
          <p>PuppyFace needed a logo to promote its public recognition and personality. The logo design begun with sketches of various puppy faces and evolved into a simple illustration of a puppies face with round eyes, nose, pink tongue and two big ears.
            Round eyes, nose, and pink tongue display cute personality. Dropped ears present relaxation. Shaded yellow color conveys a feeling of reliability and stable. So the logo itself transmits a message of cuteness and loyalty. </p>

            profile, reservations. I conducted simple preference testing using paper prototype. From the feedback, I learned that users prefer information in a row rather than in columns. The “z” eye tracking theory can explain this result well. </p>

          <p>I created high fidelity wireframes through Sketch and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xByyZDhvOK6NVyLDIdc8csVGY1NAi5i0/view?usp=sharing">clickable prototype </a>through InvisionApp. Usability testings were performed to check if the
            design has good usability. I conducted three rounds of usability testings through online tests and in-person tests. </p>
          <p>First Round Usability Testing</p>
          <p>PuppyFace app is tested by three users remotely on UserTesting.com. Testers are required to finish the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Book a service for pet boarding</li>
            <li>Check booking status</li>
            <li>View request from other pet owner</li>
            <li>View other pet owner profile</li>
            <li>View his/her own profile</li>
            <li>View pet’s profile</li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xByyZDhvOK6NVyLDIdc8csVGY1NAi5i0/view?usp=sharing">feedbacks </a> from three testers, I modified my design:</p>
          <p>(1) Follow iOS Human Interface Guideline by changing the navigation bar, profile, and search, etc.</p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-profilecompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>(2) Redesign reservation page because testers complained that it was confusing. It was hard to tell which was booking and which was the request from other pet owners. Reservation was separated into “Your bookings” and “Requests” instead of “Past”
            and “Upcoming.” Users would like to know which was booking and which was request first, then they want to know which is upcoming or previous. There was a hierarchy of the user’s need. </p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-reservationcompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>(3) Add “skip” option in onboarding process to allow users to view contents without registering or logging in</p>
          <p>Second Round Usability Testing</p>
          <p>I conducted three in-person tests and one remote test. The purpose of the second-round test was to check if modified design solves the problems revealed in round one test, and review some more details about the app. I assigned these tasks to
            testers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Book a service for pet boarding</li>
            <li>Check booking status</li>
            <li>Tell if the app is for pet owner, or pet sitter, or for both. And why?</li>
            <li>What’s biggest difference between this app and other pet service app?</li>
            <li>Share pet’s photo in community</li>
            <li>What do you think about the search filter</li>
            <li>What do you think about sitter’s profile page</li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xByyZDhvOK6NVyLDIdc8csVGY1NAi5i0/view?usp=sharing">feedbacks </a> from three testers, I modified my design:</p>
          <p>(1) Redesign booking page, change communication icon and group action icons together, so it was convenient for users to take actions. I also grouped pet sitter’s information, so it was easy for users to browse information. </p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-bookingcompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>(2) Add more options to filter and place options by priority. Even though users can find pet sitters’ experience, reviews in their profiles, but they prefer filter can help them exclude some options. From my interviews, I found out that users
            would like to exclude or include some pet sitters with bad reviews, and they have specific requirements for pet sitters’ experience. One user wanted pet sitter with experience with puppies, the other wanted pet sitter with experience with
            rescue dogs. So I redesign the filter and add these options to filter. </p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-filtercompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>Third Round Usability Testing</p>
          <p>I conducted <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xByyZDhvOK6NVyLDIdc8csVGY1NAi5i0/view?usp=sharing">three preference tests  </a>on usabilityhub.com to polish some details of the design. According to the feedbacks, I modified my design:</p>
          <p>According to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xByyZDhvOK6NVyLDIdc8csVGY1NAi5i0/view?usp=sharing">feedbacks </a> from three testers, I modified my design:</p>
          <p>(1) Use bold orange border for pet owner’s profile picture to make it more noticeable. </p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-preference1.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>(2) One user was confused by the availability calendar, so I redesigned it to make it more clear. I added lines to cross out unavailable dates and use green to highlight available dates. </p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-preference2.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>(3) Users complained blur background image has no focal point, and the letters were blended in the background and hard to read. So I changed the transparency of background picture and added shadow to letters to increase the readability of messages.

          <p>What I learned during the processing of creating PuppyFace is that details are vital to a product. When users are using a product, any particulars could become a reason why user love the product or a reason why users feel frustrated. I also
            learned that usability testing is critical. How users use the product could be entirely different from what a designer thinks it should be. </p>
          <p>What to do in the future? PuppyFace provides pet owners a way to find reliable pet sitters and solve the problem of high cost of pet services. The final goal of PuppyFace is to create a mutually beneficial community for all pet lovers. But there
            is still something I need to improve in the future. Users may not realize pet service on the PuppyFace app is exchanged by credits not by money if they skip the onboarding process. I need to spend more time to improve the visibility of credit
            exchange policy. Because this is a prominent feature of the PuppyFace app, and what makes PuppyFace app distinguished from the rest of pet service apps. What gave me confidence during our usability testing phase was that most users love the
            idea of credit exchange services, and I got very positive and supportive feedback. </p>
