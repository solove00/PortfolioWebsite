  <!--OVERVIEW-->
  <section id="overview">
      <div class="first">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h3">Since the dawn of the ice age, humans and animals have had a special bond. They are like family to us. We love
            our pets so much and would like to take good care of them whenever we can. When we are away, we would like to
            find someone that love our pets as much as we do to take care of them. PuppyFace is an app that offers reliable
            and free pet services to your pets. Why is PuppyFace free? Because we encourage pet owners to help each other,
            we use credits as a way to record when a pet owner provide or receive service. The purpose is to reduce the cost
            of pet service, and at the same time, our pets receive services from other pet owners which is more reliable.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Problem</h4>
      </div>


      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">Even though there are many pet services apps in the marketplace, many of the current service providers are expensive
            and can’t meet pet owner’s requirements for cost and service. Rover is the most significant pet boarding app
            right now. But many pet sitters on Rover are asking for expensive service fees regardless of their service quality.
            Pet service fee is much higher for holidays. Traveling out of town during holidays become more difficult when
            you have to consider the cost, and worry about your pet’s stay at somebody’s house. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Solutions</h4>
      </div>


      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">PuppyFace solves the problems of expensive and unreliable pet services by building a credit based service exchange
            system between pet owners. With PuppyFace, pet owners can specify their preference for a boarding place, pet
            sitter’s experience, then book a service using credits (PuppyFace will give every new user ten free credits to
            start with). And at the same time, pet owners can also receive and check service requests from other pet owners.
            If the service request is accepted and finished, then the pet owner will gain credits and can be used for future
            pet service for his/her pets. Since the platform is not money involved and pet owners provide service to each
            other, PuppyFace is a more reliable and low-cost tool to find pet service. </p>

     <div>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">I designed a
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyfQpz-IJJ0KqQTyvYsCrV8igSK0QDakHX18-lpEPZAr3-XA/viewform?usp=sf_link">user research survey</a> to know my target users. My questionnaire focused on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What people do with their pets when they travel;</li>
            <li>Where do they find daycare or boarding places for their pets;</li>
            <li>What concerns do they have for pet daycare/boarding;</li>
            <li>For the places your pets usually go to boarding/daycare, what do they think they can improve;</li>
            <li>Do they like to try a new app that can help them find free and reliable pet daycare/boarding.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Results were gathered from 12 respondents across the country.</p>
    </div>


      <div>
        <img src="/images/survey2.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%">
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I summarized the data and figured out pet owner’s motivation, frustration, and concerns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pet owners usually put their pets in boarding or someone’s home when they travel;</li>
          <li>Pet owners find pet boarding places through the internet;</li>
          <li>Safety, cost, experience were the most important considerations;</li>
          <li>They would like the pets boarding places they usually send their pets can lower the price;</li>
          <li>61% of respondents liked to try a new app that can help them find FREE pet daycare/boarding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is clear that from these survey results pet owners wanted a search tool that can find reliable and low-cost
          pet services.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Personas</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">I conducted one-on-one interviews with three of my survey respondents to find out more details about their responses
          and help us understand the problem better. From these interviews, I developed three personas and identified there
          are three major user groups:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Caro represents pet owners who live in small towns where limited pet hotels are available;</li>
          <li>Tara represents pet owners who have limited incomes like students, they prefer cheaper cost for pet services;</li>
          <li>Max represents pet owners who live in a costly area like San Francisco, they like the idea of credit exchange
            for pet services. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-persona1.png" class="center-block" style="width:50%" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>The demand for reliable and cheaper pet service is popular. I also identified some features for implementation
          in the future development process, such as adding filters for senior dog experience, puppy experience, rescue
          dog experience, etc.
