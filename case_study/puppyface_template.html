      <div class="first">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h3">Since the dawn of the ice age, humans and animals have had a special bond. They are like family to us. We love
            our pets so much and would like to take good care of them whenever we can. When we are away, we would like to
            find someone that love our pets as much as we do to take care of them. PuppyFace is an app that offers reliable
            and free pet services to your pets. Why is PuppyFace free? Because we encourage pet owners to help each other,
            we use credits as a way to record when a pet owner provide or receive service. The purpose is to reduce the cost
            of pet service, and at the same time, our pets receive services from other pet owners which is more reliable.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Problem</h4>
      </div>


      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">Even though there are many pet services apps in the marketplace, many of the current service providers are expensive
            and can’t meet pet owner’s requirements for cost and service. Rover is the most significant pet boarding app
            right now. But many pet sitters on Rover are asking for expensive service fees regardless of their service quality.
            Pet service fee is much higher for holidays. Traveling out of town during holidays become more difficult when
            you have to consider the cost, and worry about your pet’s stay at somebody’s house. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Solutions</h4>
      </div>


      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">PuppyFace solves the problems of expensive and unreliable pet services by building a credit based service exchange
            system between pet owners. With PuppyFace, pet owners can specify their preference for a boarding place, pet
            sitter’s experience, then book a service using credits (PuppyFace will give every new user ten free credits to
            start with). And at the same time, pet owners can also receive and check service requests from other pet owners.
            If the service request is accepted and finished, then the pet owner will gain credits and can be used for future
            pet service for his/her pets. Since the platform is not money involved and pet owners provide service to each
            other, PuppyFace is a more reliable and low-cost tool to find pet service. </p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p class="p-after-h3">xxx</p>
    </div>

     <div>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">I designed a
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyfQpz-IJJ0KqQTyvYsCrV8igSK0QDakHX18-lpEPZAr3-XA/viewform?usp=sf_link">user research survey</a> to know my target users. My questionnaire focused on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What people do with their pets when they travel;</li>
            <li>Where do they find daycare or boarding places for their pets;</li>
            <li>What concerns do they have for pet daycare/boarding;</li>
            <li>For the places your pets usually go to boarding/daycare, what do they think they can improve;</li>
            <li>Do they like to try a new app that can help them find free and reliable pet daycare/boarding.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Results were gathered from 12 respondents across the country.</p>
    </div>


      <div>
        <img src="/images/survey2.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%">
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I summarized the data and figured out pet owner’s motivation, frustration, and concerns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pet owners usually put their pets in boarding or someone’s home when they travel;</li>
          <li>Pet owners find pet boarding places through the internet;</li>
          <li>Safety, cost, experience were the most important considerations;</li>
          <li>They would like the pets boarding places they usually send their pets can lower the price;</li>
          <li>61% of respondents liked to try a new app that can help them find FREE pet daycare/boarding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is clear that from these survey results pet owners wanted a search tool that can find reliable and low-cost
          pet services.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Personas</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">I conducted one-on-one interviews with three of my survey respondents to find out more details about their responses
          and help us understand the problem better. From these interviews, I developed three personas and identified there
          are three major user groups:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Caro represents pet owners who live in small towns where limited pet hotels are available;</li>
          <li>Tara represents pet owners who have limited incomes like students, they prefer cheaper cost for pet services;</li>
          <li>Max represents pet owners who live in a costly area like San Francisco, they like the idea of credit exchange
            for pet services. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-persona1.png" class="center-block" style="width:50%" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>The demand for reliable and cheaper pet service is popular. I also identified some features for implementation
          in the future development process, such as adding filters for senior dog experience, puppy experience, rescue
          dog experience, etc.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">After having a comprehensive understanding of my target audience and what they need, I start to do
          <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f4994zjvvqex3ji/Competitive%20Analysis.docx?dl=0">SWOT analysis</a> for three popular pet service apps (Rover, Pawshake, PetBacker) in the market. I made a
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10cijwizWoLXh6gYYSk9pc6r75SzkjgYaYl2DLh-yJTA/edit?usp=sharing">feature list </a>of these three apps comparing all their features. And I examined their UI/UX designs in details
            by testing out these apps myself and reading app reviews. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-competitors.png" class="center-block" style="width:80%">
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>User Stories</h4>
      </div>

      <div >
        <p>Based on all the surveys, interviews and competitive analysis, I came up with
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m7Miami0_XX43r-cFmpp5st0dR9FMb3082TY7qsx-tU/edit?usp=sharing">a list of user stories</a> to meet the needs of pet owners.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>User Flows &amp; Sitemap</h4>
      </div>

      <div >
        <p class="p-after-h4">I converted user stories into
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xByyZDhvOK6NVyLDIdc8csVGY1NAi5i0/view?usp=sharing">user flows </a>and
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O51_ieWTFVPCDU-uzq_WSBEYrYSnmQXN/view?usp=sharing">sitemap</a> to visualize the navigation process and content hierarchy. In this part, I not only referred to the
          competitors’ UX design process and also referred to some resource sharing apps’ design process, including Airbnb,
          Lyft, and Uber.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h3>Branding</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h3">Many logos of pet’s brands can be divided into two groups: (1)colorful pet image to display a happy pet; (2)one color strokes to present a feeling of clean and simple. From my research, I concluded that this product needed to get a balance between these two. Because the cuteness of pets can attract users, and the cleanness and simple
            can make users feel reliable.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Typography</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4"> Righteous is an open sans typeface. Its round bowl, counter, and aperture create a feeling of decor and cuteness.
              It is suitable for headlines and reminds people of the cuteness of puppies.</p>
          <p>Gudea’s sans serif displays a simple, condensed structure that brings a pleasant feeling when used at any size.
              Gudea was initially used in engineering documents. It also provides a sense of reliability.</p></p>
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Brand Story &amp; Logo</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-brand1.jpg" class="center-block" style="width:30%">
      </div>

      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-brand2.jpg" class="center-block" style="width:30%">
      </div>

      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-brand3.jpg" class="center-block" style="width:30%">
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">The word “puppyface” came up when I was browsing some dog’s facebook pages. Puppy with cute and smiling faces usually
              gets a lot more “likes.” People’s heart is melty when they see a puppy. When I first walked my dog in the community
              as he was a puppy, he drew a lot of attention from my neighbors like a superstar. It is hard for people to ignore
              puppies’ innocent and adorable faces. </p>
            <p>PuppyFace needed a logo to promote its public recognition and personality. The logo design begun with sketches
              of various puppy faces and evolved into a simple illustration of a puppies face with round eyes, nose, pink tongue
              and two big ears. Round eyes, nose, and pink tongue display cute personality. Dropped ears present relaxation.
              Shaded yellow color conveys a feeling of reliability and stable. So the logo itself transmits a message of cuteness
              and loyalty. </p>

          <img src="/images/Puppyface-brandlogo.png" class="center-block" style="width:60%">

      <div>
          <h4>Colors</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">PuppyFace needs a color palette to trigger people’s feeling for pets. Bright green and bright orange are chosen
            to present pet’s happiness. The orange color reminds people of dog’s activeness, and green color reminds people
            of dogs playing on grass. The color inspiration came from playing with my dog in a park.</p>

          <h4>Paper Prototype</h4>

        <img src="/images/Puppyface-paper1.jpg" class="center-block" style="width:30%">

      <div>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-paper2.jpg" class="center-block" style="width:30%">
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">I started paper prototype by quickly sketching the structures. While I was outlining, I focus on providing information
            and features pet owners concerned the most. Paper prototype allowed me to quickly create different layouts for
            sitter list, profile, reservations. I conducted simple preference testing using paper prototype. From the feedback,
            I learned that users prefer information in a row rather than in columns. The “z” eye tracking theory can explain
            this result well.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">I created
            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ccsxhaqanjsife2/PuppyFace%20Balsamiq.pdf?dl=0">low fidelity wireframes </a>through Balsamiq to simulate the desired interaction flow and feel of the product.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
         <img src="/images/Puppyface-lowfi.png" class="center-block" style="width:80%">
      </div>

      <div>
          <h4>Mockups</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h4">I created high fidelity wireframes through Sketch and
            <a href="https://invis.io/KQG614RXBGU">clickable prototype </a>through InvisionApp. Usability testings were performed to check if the design has good
            usability. I conducted three rounds of usability testings through online tests and in-person tests.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
         <h4>First Round Usability Test</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">PuppyFace app was tested by three users remotely on UserTesting.com. Testers were required to finish the following
          tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Book a service for pet boarding</li>
            <li>Check booking status</li>
            <li>View requests from other pet owners</li>
            <li>View other pet owner's profile</li>
            <li>View his/her own profile</li>
            <li>View pet’s profile</li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AO2EDIwZK5Hd7F3biyAoSQZlHtJ4p65rpCGG4QJkU60/edit?usp=sharing">feedbacks </a> from three testers, I modified my design:
          <br>(1) Follow iOS Human Interface Guideline by changing the navigation bar, profile, and search, etc.</p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-profilecompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%">
          <p>(2) Redesign reservation page because testers complained that it was confusing. It was hard to tell which was booking
            and which was the request from other pet owners. Reservation was separated into “Your bookings” and “Requests”
            instead of “Past” and “Upcoming.” Users would like to know which was booking and which was request first, then
            they want to know which is upcoming or previous. There was a hierarchy of the user’s need. </p>
          <img src="/images/Puppyface-reservationcompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
          <p>(3) Add “skip” option in onboarding process to allow users to view contents without registering or logging in</p>
      </div>

     <div>
          <h4>Second Round Usability Test</h4>
     </div>

     <div>
       <p class="p-after-h4">I conducted three in-person tests and one remote test. The purpose of the second-round test was to check if modified
         design solves the problems revealed in round one test, and review some more details about the app. I assigned
         these tasks to testers:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Book a service for pet boarding</li>
         <li>Check booking status</li>
         <li>Tell if the app is for pet owner, or pet sitter, or for both. And why?</li>
         <li>What’s biggest difference between this app and other pet service app?</li>
         <li>Share pet’s photo in community</li>
         <li>What do you think about the search filter</li>
         <li>What do you think about sitter’s profile page</li>
       </ul>
       <p>According to the
         <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2a1K1zMFBsOvPOyS35v7YEYO7RpgNQCU0yhY_4TbMk/edit?usp=sharing">feedbacks </a> from three testers, I modified my design:
         <br>(1) Redesign booking page, change communication icon and group action icons together, so it was convenient for
         users to take actions. I also grouped pet sitter’s information, so it was easy for users to browse information.
       </p>
       <img src="/images/Puppyface-bookingcompare.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
       <p>(2) Add more options to filter and place options by priority. Even though users can find pet sitters’ experience,
         reviews in their profiles, but they prefer filter can help them exclude some options. From my interviews, I found
         out that users would like to exclude or include some pet sitters with bad reviews, and they have specific requirements
         for pet sitters’ experience. One user wanted pet sitter with experience with puppies, the other wanted pet sitter
         with experience with rescue dogs. So I redesign the filter and add these options to filter. </p>

        <h4>Third Round Usability Testing</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="p-after-h4">I conducted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pq4ZRGIH0XosFw9SAN4BNRrCVdXm5TqtAQJnMFsJyPc/edit?usp=sharing">three preference tests </a>on usabilityhub.com to polish some details of the design. According to the feedbacks
          from three testers, I modified my design:<br>(1) Use bold orange border for pet owner’s profile picture to make it more noticeable. </p>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-preference1.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
        <p>(2) One user was confused by the availability calendar, so I redesigned it to make it more clear. I added lines
          to cross out unavailable dates and use green to highlight available dates. </p>
        <img src="/images/Puppyface-preference2.png" class="center-block" style="width:70%" />
        <p>(3) Users complained blur background image has no focal point, and the letters were blended in the background and
          hard to read. So I changed the transparency of background picture and added shadow to letters to increase the
          readability of messages.

          <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
          <p class="p-after-h3">What I learned during the processing of creating PuppyFace is that details are vital to a product. When users are
              using a product, any particulars could become a reason why user love the product or a reason why users feel frustrated.
              I also learned that usability testing is critical. How users use the product could be entirely different from
              what a designer thinks it should be. </p>
            <p>What to do in the future? PuppyFace provides pet owners a way to find reliable pet sitters and solve the problem
              of high cost of pet services. The final goal of PuppyFace is to create a mutually beneficial community for all
              pet lovers. But there is still something I need to improve in the future. Users may not realize pet service on
              the PuppyFace app is exchanged by credits not by money if they skip the onboarding process. I need to spend more
              time to improve the visibility of credit exchange policy. Because this is a prominent feature of the PuppyFace
              app, and what makes PuppyFace app distinguished from the rest of pet service apps. What gave me confidence during
              our usability testing phase was that most users love the idea of credit exchange services, and I got very positive
              and supportive feedback. </p>
