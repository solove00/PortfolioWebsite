      <h4>Problem</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">People try to invest in the stock market in their spare time. Many of them are not professional stock traders or don’t
        have finance background. Many stock trading websites are not beginner friendly because of outdated UI designs
        with redundant information and options. Beginners are easy to get overwhelmed by the design of the websites itself.
        For example, Scottrade and Fidelity have very complicated UX process and have long submenus for each dropdown.
        They provide too much information including news, market trends, etc., which users can also find from many other
        news sources not the trading website.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Solutions</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">Bounce solves the problems of complicated stocking trading for beginners. The stock trading website I designed is very
        beginner friendly with information and options both specifically curated for beginners. I carried out series of surveys and usability tests to find
        out the information that is needed for beginners and the best design help them trade easily. </p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>User Research</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">I designed a
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdD3bwCB3V804nyEzlFvjoq2pgWIwmjg6JDjQUsO6KVodU-Qw/viewform?usp=sf_link">user research survey</a> to know my target users. My questionnaire focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many times do they trade stock every year;</li>
        <li>How many years of experience do they have;</li>
        <li>What frustrations they have with their current brokers;</li>
        <li>What do they think their broker can be improved;</li>
        <li>What information they would like to get from a stock trading website.</li>
        <li>What features are important to them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Results were gathered from 27 respondents who are interested in stock trading across the country.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <img src="/images/bounce/r-survey.png" class="center-block large">
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Those who are not interested in stocking trading were excluded from the survey by the first question, so only data
        of those 26 respondents who are interested in stock trading were collected. I summarized the datas and figured out
        my target audiences, their frustrations and needs. </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>93% of who are interested in stock trading ranges from 18 ~ 45 yrs. Since most of the users ranger from 18~45 yrs,
          we can make a trendy design which may be appealing to investors</li>
        <li>Only 38% are happy with their current brokers, 62% think their brokers can be improve in some ways, 26% think they
          are very difficult to use (See Question 5)</li>
        <li>27% feel frustrated when they miss companies important events (See Question 5)</li>
        <li>They want simple design for beginners, easier money transfer from bank, organized stock transactions (See Question
          6)
        </li>
        <li>They want to about a company’s earning/revenue growth, stock type(dividend type, growth type etc.), cash flow (See
          Question 8) </li>
        <li>They want an important event calendar with alerts, price change notification, filters for stock selection (See Question
          9) </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Personas</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">I conducted video interviews with three of my survey respondents to know more about their trading background and lifestyle.
        From these interviews, I developed three personas and identified there are three major user groups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Michael represents stock traders who want to know company financials and big events;</li>
        <li>Tara represents stock traders who know very few about stock market and want simplified user interface.</li>
        <li>Max represents stock traders who think current brokers are difficult to use, and he need something simple;</li>
      </ul>

    <div>
      <p>The demand for simple and easy design for stock trading beginner is popular. I also identified some features for implementation
        in the future development process, such as stock picker based on market cap, earning growth, revenue, etc.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">After having a comprehensive understanding of my target audiences and what they need, I started to do
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UMlXHJb1bm06ED5TWSzSP6-xSgT7ysngr5QqluOQAY/edit?usp=sharing">SWOT analysis </a> for three popular stock trading brokers (Robinhood, Interactive Broker, Fidelity) in the market.
        And I examined their UI/UX designs in details by testing out these websites myself and reading app reviews.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">Based on all the surveys, interviews and competitive analysis, I came up with
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWNRlF99Y8X1tD5BQXsGQsywWjTiDX5cSYViRaNGiuY/edit?usp=sharing">a list of user stories.</a> While making a list of user stories, I only pick those features and information that
        audience want the most based on the survey. And those features that users doesn’t want (Like news feed, comment area,
        a list of stock invested by great investors) I didn’t put it on the user stories list. But these features can be
        saved for future development of the website. For now I just made a simple design and will continue to do more usability
        tests and add some necessary features.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>User Flows &amp; Sitemap</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">I converted user stories into
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1esB_uuMXPAI7hDfQXasxfPUBsiu9x5Ic/view?usp=sharing">user flows</a> and
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19SRpn0UdRkrSJLASSdhx3RZqPzFi5tff/view?usp=sharing">sitemap</a> to visualize the navigation process and content hierarchy. In this part, I not only referred to the competitors’
        UX design process and also referred to some websites that provide stock resource, including Simply Wall St and other
        financial websites like Barron’s, Seeking Alpha.

      <h4>Typography</h4>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">Bounce needs two simple typefaces to make the design and content easy to read. Noto Sans and Arimo are both sans-serif
        typeface. They are simple and they both give the design a modern look when compared to serif typeface.
      </p>
      <p>Noto Sans was designed to help make the web more beautiful. It's "little boxes" style will give the website a harmonious look and feel. Arimo was designed to display an innovative, refreshing
        feeling. It also offers improved on-screen readability which is good for content text. Both typefaces have a neutral
        feel and can work in a variety style.

    <div>
      <p>“Never try to time the market and nobody has ever done this successfully and consistently”, the saying is a golden
        rule for stock trading. That’s because the market itself is bouncing up and down and nobody can catch the lowest
        point and highest point consistently. So going up and down is the natural and normal behavior of stock market. So
        here comes the name “Bounce” for my stock trading website. Bounce itself reflects the attribute and movement of stocks.
        And this attribute is embedded into many people’s mind. If you ask people what they think of stock market, they may
        say it is like rollercoaster. </p>
      <p>Bounce needs a logo to promote its public recognition and personality. The logo design begun with various sketches
        of letter “B” combined with arrows and evolved into a simple illustration of an arrow. The arrows itself looks like
        a letter “B”. It indicates positively that the stock market is going up. The green color in stock market means gain.
        So it help to fortify the feeling of making money in stock market. </p>
      <p>The name “Bounce” provides a neutral feeling and the logo conveys a feeling of positive and make the combination tend
        to be positive. </p>

      <p class="p-after-h4">Dark blue was chosen as the main color for its association with security and trust. The white color was chosen to balance dark background. Grey is chosen as the color
        for texts and some inactive icons. Light blue was the pop color for buttons. Green and red are standard colors for the stock market. They were used to highlight some data or charts.

    <div>
      <p>I did full paper prototype for the entire website including many features. I choose to do that because paper prototype
        is very helpful from my experience. It helps to save a lot of time in the later development process. When I did the
        low fidelity wireframe later, I can just use the paper prototype as reference. </p>
      <p>One in-person user test was done to test the navigation and contents. The user was asked to finish the following tasks,
        and he provided a lot of good suggestions in the 40 minutes video. </p>
      <p>The user was asked to finish the following tasks:</p>

      <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>Log in/Sign up</li>
        <li>Buy 20 shares Apple stock at market price</li>
        <li>Buy 20 shares Apple stocks at limit price</li>
        <li>Buy 10 shares Applied Material stocks at limit price</li>
        <li>How to find a stock that meets your requirements</li>
        <li>How to set notifications</li>
        <li>Where is your profile information and how to change?</li>

        the website:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>Only show the last four digits of users’ social security numbers</li>
        <li>Change the wording of “go to homepage” to “start trading” or “let’s make some money”</li>
        <li>Use radio button design for “Order Type” and “Expiration Type” </li>
        <li>Change “balance” to “cash balance” </li>
        <li>Highlight price in order reviewing section</li>
        <li>Move stock price section above trade section</li>
        <li>Change the wording of “filter” to “stock picker” or “stock screener”</li>
        <li>Remove “share price” section on stock page</li>
        <li>Add dividend section on stock page</li>
        <li>Replace infinite symbol with the largest market cap</li>
        <li>Add a sorting feature for stock picker results</li>
        <li>Customize notifications for each stock</li>

    <div>
      <p class="p-after-h4">I created
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1swgThQ2ZaY-a_ARg5R-Puz959KFKjIrv?usp=sharing">low fidelity wireframes </a>through Sketch to simulate the desired interaction flow and feel of the product.The purpose
        of the low fidelity wireframe test is to check if the design has the right navigation, and if people can find the
        right content and finish task easily. I created
        <a href="https://invis.io/5RH0U1NS7NW">clickable low fidelity prototype</a> by InVision and using Usertest.io to finish the test. I required the test website
        to recruit five users between 18~45 years old who are interested in stock trading. The reason why I only recruit
        people between 18~45 is that according to the survey at the beginning of the project I already knew that these people
        are the majority population of stock trading beginners. </p>
      <p>The whole usability testing process consists of seven tasks and three questions. They are listed below:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>Imagine you are a stock trading beginner, you don't have an account, please sign up.</li>
        <li>Please purchase 20 shares of Apple stock at market price.</li>
        <li>Imagine you own AMAT (Applied Material) stock, please sell 10 shares at a limit price ($53.00).</li>
        <li>You would like to turn on/ off notifications (such as price change/big events/new product release) for all stocks
          on the watchlist. How would you do it?</li>
        <li>Imagine you want to find a stock that meets certain requirements (such as growth rate, earnings), can you find it
          and add it to your watchlist?</li>
        <li>If you want to know whether a stock is overvalued/undervalued, where would you find this information?</li>
        <li>Please find out where to transfer money to/from banks.</li>
        <li>What made you frustrated when using the website? </li>
        <li>What's good about this website? </li>
        <li>What can we do to improve the website?</li>
      </ul>
