          <p>People try to invest in the stock market in their spare time. Many of them are not professional stock traders or
            don’t have finance background. But many stock trading websites are not beginner friendly because of outdated
            UI designs with redundant information and options. Beginners are easy to get overwhelmed by the design of the
            websites itself. For example, Scottrade and Fidelity have very complicated UX process and have long submenus
            for each dropdown. And they provide too much information including news, market trends, etc., which users can
            also find from many other news sources not the trading website.

          <p>Didact Gothic was designed to present each letter in the form most often used in elementary classrooms. It works

          <p>“Never try to time the market and nobody has ever done this successfully and consistently”, the saying is a golden
            rule for stock trading. That’s because the market itself is bouncing up and down and nobody can catch the lowest
            point and highest point consistently. So going up and down is the natural and normal behavior of stock market.
            So here comes the name “Bounce” for my stock trading website. Bounce itself reflects the attribute and movement
            of stocks. And this attribute is embedded into many people’s mind. If you ask people what they think of stock
            market, they may say it is like rollercoaster. </p>
          <p>Bounce needs a logo to promote its public recognition and personality. The logo design begun with various sketches
            of letter “B” combined with arrows and evolved into a simple illustration of an arrow. The arrows itself looks
            like a letter “B”. It indicates positively that the stock market is going up. The green color in stock market
            means gain. So it help to fortify the feeling of making money in stock market. </p>
          <p>The name “Bounce” provide a neutral feeling and the logo conveys a feeling of positive and make the combination
            tend to be positive. </p>

          <p>I did full paper prototype for the entire website including many features. I choose to do that because paper prototype
            is very helpful from my experience. It helps to save a lot of time in the later development process. When I did
            the low fidelity wireframe later, I can just use the paper prototype as reference. </p>
          <p>One in-person user test was done to test the navigation and contents. The user was asked to finish the following
            tasks, and he provided a lot of good suggestions in the 40 minutes video. </p>
          <p>The user was asked to finish the following tasks:</p>

            <p>I created
              <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1swgThQ2ZaY-a_ARg5R-Puz959KFKjIrv?usp=sharing">low fidelity wireframes </a>through Sketch to simulate the desired interaction flow and feel of the product.The
              purpose of the low fidelity wireframe test is to check if the design has the right navigation, and if people
              can find the right content and finish task easily. I created
              <a href="https://invis.io/5RH0U1NS7NW">clickable low fidelity prototype</a> by InVision and using Usertest.io to finish the test. I required the test
              website to recruit five users between 18~45 years old who are interested in stock trading. The reason why I
              only recruit people between 18~45 is that according to the survey at the beginning of the project I already
              knew that these people are the majority population of stock trading beginners. </p>
            <p>The whole usability testing process consist of seven tasks and three questions. They are listed below:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
              <li>Imagine you are a stock trading beginner, you don't have an account, please sign up.</li>
              <li>Please purchase 20 shares of Apple stock at market price.</li>
              <li>Imagine you own AMAT (Applied Material) stock, please sell 10 shares at a limit price ($53.00).</li>
              <li>You would like to turn on/ off notifications (such as price change/big events/new product release) for all
                stocks on the watchlist. How would you do it?</li>
              <li>Imagine you want to find a stock that meets certain requirements (such as growth rate, earnings), can you find
                it and add it to your watchlist?</li>
              <li>If you want to know whether a stock is overvalued/undervalued, where would you find this information?</li>
              <li>Please find out where to transfer money to/from banks.</li>
              <li>What made you frustrated when using the website? </li>
              <li>What's good about this website? </li>
              <li>What can we do to improve the website?</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <p>I watched recorded videos of the user’s behaviors over and over again to make sure I catch every details, at
              the same time, I observed and wrote down the reactions of users. Here is a
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KvegB-0uq52oK86wairTGFcbh6COaJuVNi5Bi0fPLuI/edit?usp=sharing">
              10 pages detailed analysis</a> of five usability tests. Based on users’ feedbacks and my analysis, here are
              potential changes to the website:</p>
            <!-- <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
              <li><strong style="font-weight:bold;">Add wire transfer option: </strong>Some users may concern the safety of linking their bank account and would rather use wire transfer, Bounce should be able to provide a wire transfer.</li>
              <li><strong>Stress bank account safety: </strong>Stress bank account safety: Even though Bounce states all personal information are bank-level safe here, and bank accounts are protected by FDIC, but users may not see this explanation next to bank information. I can use an eye-catching color
                or bold font to increase the readability and get more attention.</li>
              <li><strong>Change the wording of search bar: </strong>Search is a broad concept. Users don’t know if the search bar is for stock search or web page content search. To make it clear, I can change the wording of searching bar from “search” to “want to buy some
                stocks?”, or “find your favorite stock to start trading”.</li>
              <li><strong>Change the wording of review button: </strong>Some non-tech savvy users may not understand what does “Review” button do, they may concern if they click the button, they will have to go back to the beginning of the buying process. To ease their confusion,
                I can change the wording of review button from “Review” to “Review your order”.</li>
              <li><strong>Add explanations/descriptions: </strong>To beginners, they are not familiar with what is market order and limit order, they need some explanations or descriptions.</li>
              <li><strong>Add instant response after a market order: </strong>Market order usually is filled instantly, so after the orders is filled, the sell box should refresh automatically, changing from “You don’t have any Apple stock” to “you have 20 shares APPL”.</li>
              <li><strong>Re-design the user flow for selling stocks: </strong>users should be able to view what stocks they own in two places, Account, and Portfolio (home page).</li>
              <li><strong>Increase the difference between a buy box and a sell box: </strong> Use different colors or add animation to increase the difference. For example, the letter “buy” will enlarge when buy box is chosen. The purpose is to reduce the possibility of mixing
                buy and sell.</li>
              <li ><strong>Indicate what’s the next information to fill out: </strong>users may forget to fill out some information before placing an order, there are two ways to solve the problem (a) use error reminder (b) indicate what’s the next step by making some differentiation
                between filled and to be filled.</li>
              <li><strong>Re-design user flow for notifications settings:</strong> most users expect when clicking the icon of watchlist then they will be directed to the setting of watchlist.</li>
              <li><strong>Consolidating some notification options: </strong>notifications sections are a lot to read, to make it easy for users, I can group some options.</li>
              <li><strong>Improve feedbacks after stocks are added: </strong>Current feedbacks are limited, if a user click eye icon (add to watchlist icon), only the color of eye icon will turn bright. But this color change is not enough to draw users’ attention. There are
                two things I can do to help users catch the status change easily (1) change wording from “add to watchlist” to “added to watchlist”; (2) add an instant notifications like “XXX stock is added to your watchlist” or “We help you keep an eye
                on XXX stocks”.</li>
              <li><strong>Change the wording of “industry”: </strong>Some users are not clear what will happen if they choose one or two industries. The purpose of choosing industries is to encourage people to invest in something they are interested in or something they like,
                it doesn’t matter whether it is one industry or two industries. So if I change the wording from “industry” to “Let us know what industries are you interested in”, that will be more clear to them.</li>
              <li><strong>Options for users to know more about value calculation: </strong>Users would like to know how the website decide if a stock is overvalued or undervalued. I can provide a small icon next to calculation or a link to show how we calculate the value and
                how we get the numbers. </li>
              <li><strong>Add drop-down menu: </strong>users prefer drop-down menu to preview the content on each page because right now, they don’t know where they are and where the button will lead to. Presenting a drop-down menu when hovering can solve this problem.</li>
              <li><strong>Simplified company introduction: </strong>Provide basic information like location, business, and also provide an option if users want to read more. Removing extra words from the design will make the reading easy and make the UI cleaner. Some users
                don’t want to read it if too much information is provided. </li>
              <li><strong>Allow users to jump to certain content on the stock page: </strong>There are two reasons why users assume that stock value section is in the Stock Picker (a) the last task is to use stock picker to pick a stock, there are several options in the picker,
                users don’t remember all the options and think “value section” may be there; (b) the “value” information is actually on the stock page itself, users don’t see it there because there are too many information on the stock page. If I add a
                menu on the stock pages, It will help users navigate to “value” section, and help them recognize information on the stock page. There is a lot useful information on the stock page, and users are easy to get lost. Providing a feature to allow
                users to jump to certain content can help users find what they want easily. </li>
              <li><strong></strong>Focus on beginner use and prevent overkill by providing tips and description.</li>
